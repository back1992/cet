Surviving the Recession

英语四级考试网 www.CET4V.com 经典奉献 1

英语四级考试网 www.CET4V.com 鼎力帮助考生顺利通过大学英语四级考试！

America's recession began quietly at the end of 2007. Since then it has evolved into a
global crisis. Reasonable people may disagree about whom to blame. Financiers who
were not as clever as they thought they were? Regulators falling asleep at work?
Consumers who borrowed too much? Politicians who thoughtlessly promoted
home-ownership for those who could not afford it? All are guilty; and what a mess they
have created.
Since 2007 America has shed 5 million jobs. More than 15% of the workforce are
jobless or underemployed - roughly 25 million workers. The only industries swelling
their payrolls are health care, utilities and the federal government. The value of listed
shares in American firms collapsed by 57% from its peak in October 2007 to a low in
March this year, though it has since bounced back somewhat. Industrial production fell
by 12. 8% in the year to March, the worst slide since the Second World War. Mark Zandi,
and economist at Moody's Economy, com, predicts that the recession will shrink
America's economy by 3.5% in total. For most executives, this is the worst business
environment they've ever seen.
Times are so tough that even bosses are taking pay cuts. Median (中位数的) pay for
chief executives of S&P 500 companies fell 6.8% in 2008. The overthrown business giants
of Wall Street took the biggest knock, with average pay cuts of 38% and median bonuses
of zero. But there was some pain for everyone; median pay for chief executives of
non-financial firms in the S&P 500 fell by 2.7%.
Nearly every business has a sad tale to tell. For example, Arne Sorenson, the
president of Marriott hotels, likens the crisis to the downturn that hit his business after
September 11th, 2001. When the twin towers fell, Americans stopped travelling. Marriott
had its worst quarter ever, with revenues per room falling by 25%. This year, without a
terrorist attack, the hotel industry is "putting the same numbers on the board", says Mr.
Sorenson.
The hotel bust (不景气), like most busts, was preceded by a breathtaking boom.
Although many other big firms resisted the temptation to over-borrow, developers
borrowed heavily and built bigger and fancier hotels as if the whole world were
planning a holiday in Las Vegas. When the bubble burst, demand collapsed. Hotel
owners found themselves with a huge number of empty rooms even as a lot of
unnecessary new hotels were ready to open.
Other industries have suffered even more. Large numbers of builders, property
firms and retailers have gone bankrupt. And a disaster has hit Detroit. Last year the
American car industry had the capacity to make 17 million vehicles. Sales in 2009 could
be barely half of that. The Big Three American carmakers - General Motors, Ford and
Chrysler - accumulated ruinous costs over the post-war years, such as gold-plated health
plans and pensions for workers who retired as young as 48. All three are desperately
restructuring. Only Ford may survive in its current form.
Hard times breed hard feelings. Few Americans understand what caused the
recession. Some are seeking scapegoats (替罪羊). Politicians are happy to take advantage.
Bosses have been summoned to Washington to be scolded on live television. The
president condemns their greed.

Extravagance (奢侈) is out
Businessfolk are bending over backwards to avoid seeming extravagant. Meetings at
resorts are suddenly unacceptable. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, cancelled a
conference in Las Vegas at the last minute and rebooked it in San Francisco, which cost
more but sounded less fun.
Anyway, the pain will eventually end. American business will regain its shine.
Many firms will die, but the survivors will emerge leaner and stronger than before. The
financial sector's share of the economy will shrink, and stay shrunk for years to come.
The importance of non-financial firms will accordingly rise, along with their ability to
attract the best talent. America will remain the best place on earth to do business, so long
as Barack Obama and the Democrats in Congress resist the temptation to interfere too
much, and so long as organised labour does not overplay its hand.
The crisis will prove hugely disruptive ( 破 坏 性 的 ) , however. Bad management
techniques will be exposed. Necessity will force the swift adoption of more efficient ones.
At the same time, technological innovation (创新) will barely pause for breath- and two
big political changes seem likely.
Mr. Obama's plan to curb carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions (排放), though necessary,
will be far from cost-free, whatever his sunny speeches on the subject might suggest. The
shift to a low-carbon economy will help some firms, hurt others and require every
organisation that uses much energy to rethink how it operates. It is harder to predict how
Mr. Obama's proposed reforms to the failing health-care system will turn out. If he
succeeds in curbing costs - a big if - it would be a huge gain for America. Some
businesses will benefit but the vast bulk of the savings will be captured by workers, not
their employers.
In the next couple of years the businesses that thrive will be those that are tight with
costs, careful of debt, cautious with cash flow and extremely attentive to what customers
want. They will include plenty of names no one has yet heard of.
Times change, and corporations change with them. In 1955 Time's Man of the Year
was Harlow Curtice, the boss of GM. His firm was leading America towards "a new
economic order", the magazine wrote. Thanks to men like Curtice, "the bonds of scarcity"
had been broken and America was rolling "to an all-time high of prosperity". Soon,
Americans would need to spend "comparatively little time earning a living".
Half a century later GM is a typical example of poor management. In March its chief
executive was fired by Time's current Man of the Year. Mr. Obama. The government now
backs up the domestic car industry, lending it money and overseeing its turnaround
plans. With luck, this will be short-lived. But there is a danger that Washington will end
up micromanaging not only Detroit but also other parts of the economy. And clever as
Mr. Obama's advisers are, history suggests they will be bad at this.

daily salt intake (摄入) can lead to dramatic health benefits. The authors __48__ an annual
drop of as many as 120 000 cases of heart disease, 66 000 __49__ of stroke and 99 000

The advantages, not surprisingly, were greater for African Americans, who are more
likely to __51__ high blood pressure than other ethnic groups, and for the elderly, since
blood vessels stiffen with age, which can lead to higher blood pressure.
"Everyone in the US is consuming salt far in __52__ of what is good for them," says
lead author Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo of UCSF. "What we are suggesting is that a
population-wide effort to reduce salt intake, even __53__ will have health benefits."
The team conducted a computer-based analysis to determine the __54__ of a
3-g-per-day reduction in salt intake on rates of heart disease and death. They also
calculated the cost savings emerging from the amount of disease that would be __55__
because of lower blood pressure. The conclusion: by cutting salt intake nationwide, the
US could save $10 billion to $24 billion __56__ in health care costs.

Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or
unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You
should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a
single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
The Gatais used to frown when they received power bills that routinely topped $200.
Last September the couple moved into a 1 500-square-foot home in Premier Gardens, a
subdivision of 95 "zero-energy homes" (ZEH) just outside town. Now they're actually
英语四级考试网 www.CET4V.com 经典奉献 10

英语四级考试网 www.CET4V.com 鼎力帮助考生顺利通过大学英语四级考试！

eager to see their electricity bills. The grand total over the 10 months they've lived in the
three-bedroom house: $75. For the past two months they haven't paid a cent.
ZEH communities are the leading edge of technologies that might someday create
houses that produce as much energy as they consume. Premier Gardens is one of a
half-dozen subdivisions in California where every home cuts power consumption by
50%, mostly by using low-power appliances and solar panels.
Aside from the panels on the roof, Premier Gardens looks like a community of
conventional homes. But inside, special windows cut power bills by blocking solar heat
in summer and retaining indoor warmth in winter.
The rest of the energy savings comes from the solar units. They don't just feed the
home they serve. If they generate more power than the home is using, the excess flows
into the utility's power grid (电网). The residents are billed by "net metering": they pay for
the amount of power they tap off the grid, less the kilowatts (千瓦) they feed into it. If a
home generates more power than it uses, the bill is zero.
That sounds like a bad deal for the power company, but it's not. Solar homes
produce the most power on the hot sunny afternoons when everyone rushes home to
turn up the air conditioner. "It helps us lower usage at peak power times," says solar
expert Mike Keesee. "That lets us avoid building costly plants or buying expensive power
at peak usage time."
What's not to like? Mostly the costs. The special features can add $25000 or more to
the purchase price of a house. Tax breaks bring the cost down, especially in California,
but in many states ZEHs can be prohibitively expensive. For the consumer, it's a matter
of paying now for the hardware to save later on the utilities.

Passage Two
Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
Romantic love has clear evolutionary roots but our views about what makes an ideal
romantic relationship can be swayed by the society we live in. So says psychologist
Maureen O'Sullivan from the University of San Francisco. She suggests that humans
have always tried to strengthen the pair-bond to maximise (使最大化) reproductive
success.
Many societies throughout history and around the world today have cultivated
strong pressures to stay married. In those where ties to family and community are strong,
lifelong marriages can be promoted by practices such as the cultural prohibition of
divorce and arranged marriages that are seen as a contract between two families, not just
two individuals. In modern western societies, however, the focus on individuality and
independence means that people are less concerned about conforming to (遵守) the
dictates of family and culture. In the absence of societal pressures to maintain pair-bonds,
O'Sullivan suggests that romantic love has increasingly come to be seen as the factor that
should determine who we stay with and for how long. "That's why historically we see an
increase in romantic love as a basis for forming long-term relationships," she says.
According to O'Sullivan culture also shapes the sorts of feelings we expect to have,
英语四级考试网 www.CET4V.com 经典奉献 12

英语四级考试网 www.CET4V.com 鼎力帮助考生顺利通过大学英语四级考试！

and actually do experience, when in love. Although the negative emotions associated
with romantic love-fear of loss, disappointment and jealousy-are fairly consistent across
cultures, the positive feelings can vary. "If you ask Japanese students to list the positive
attributes they expect in a romantic partner, they rate highly things like loyalty,
commitment and devotion," says O'Sullivan. "If you ask American college women, they
expect everything under the suit: in addition to being committed, partners have to be
amusing, funny and a friend."
We judge a potential partner according to our specific cultural expectations about
what romantic love should feel like. If you believe that you have found true romance,
and your culture tells you that this is what a long-term relationship should be based on,
there is less need to rely on social or family pressures to keep couples together.
O'Sullivan argues.
