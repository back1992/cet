Part II Reading comprehension (35 minutes) 
Passage One 
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage. 


 Just five one-hundredths of an inch thick, light golden in color and with a perfect “saddle curl,” the Lay’s potato chip seems an unlikely weapon for global domination. But its maker. Frito-Lay. Thinks otherwise.” Potato chips are a snack food for the world,” said Salman Amin, the company’s head of global marketing. Amin believes there is no corner of the world that can resist the charms of a Frito-Lay potato chip. 
 Frito-Lay is the biggest snack maker in America owned by PepsiCo. and accounts for over half of the parent company’s $3 billion annual profits. But the U.S. snack food market is largely saturated, and to grow. The company has to look overseas. 
 Its strategy rests on two beliefs: first a global product offers economies of scale with which local brands cannot compete. And second, consumers in the 21st century are drawn to “global” as a concept. ”Global” does not mean products that are consciously identified as American, but ones than consumes-especially young people-see as part of a modem, innovative(创新的)world in which people are linked across cultures by shared beliefs and tastes. Potato chips are an American invention, but most Chinese, for instance, do not know than Frito-Lay is an American company. Instead, Riskey, the company’s research and development head, would hope they associate the brand with the new world of global communications and business. 
 With brand perception a crucial factor, Riskey ordered a redesign of the Frito-Lay logo(标识).The logo, along with the company’s long-held marketing image of the “irresistibility” of its chips would help facilitate the company’s global expansion. 
 The executives acknowledge that they try to swing national eating habits to a food created in America, but they deny that amounts to economic imperialism. Rater, they see Frito-Lay as spreading the benefits of free enterprise across the world. “We’re making products in those countries, we’re adapting them to the tastes of those countries, building businesses and employing people and changing lives,” said Steve Reinemund, PepsiCo’s chief executive. 


21. It is the belief of Frito-Lay’s head of global marking that_____. 
A) Potato chips can hardly be used as a weapon to dominate the world market 
B) Their company must find new ways to promote domestic sales. 
C) The light golden color enhances the charm of their company’s potato chips 
D) People the world over enjoy eating their company’s potato chips 


22. What do we learn about Frito-Lay from Paragraph 2? 
A) Its products use to be popular among overseas consumers. 
B) Its expansion has caused fierce competition in the snack marker. 
C) It gives half of its annual profits to its parent company. 
D) It needs to turn to the word market for development. 


23. One of the assumptions on which Frito-Lay bases its development strategy is that_____. 
A)consumers worldwide today are attracted by global brands 
B)local brands cannot compete successfully with American brands 
C)products suiting Chinese consumers’ needs bring more profits 
D)products identified as American will have promising market value


24. Why did Riskey have the Frito-Lay logo redesigned? 
A)To suit changing tastes of young consumers. 
B)To promote the company‘s strategy of globalization. 
C)To change the company’s long-held marketing image. 
D)To compete with other American chip producers. 


25. Frito-Lay‘s executives claim that the promoting of American food in the international market_____. 
A)won‘t affect the eating habits of the local people 
B)will lead to economic imperialism 
C)will be in the interest of the local people 
D)won’t spoil the taste of their chips 


Passage Two 
Question 26 to 30 are based on the following passage. 
 In communities north of Denver, residents are pitching in to help teachers and administrators as the Vrain school District tries to solve a $13.8 million budget shortage blamed on mismanagement. ”We’re worried about our teachers and principals, and we really don’t want to lose them because of this,” one parent sail. “If we can help ease their financial burden, we will.” 
 Teachers are grateful, but know it may be years before the district is solvent(有综合能力的). They feel really good about the parent support, but they realize it’s impossible for then to solve this problem. 
The 22,000-student district discovered the shortage last month. “It’s extraordinary. Nobody would have imagined something happening like this at this level,” said State Treasurer Mike Coffman. 
Coffman and district officials last week agreed on a state emergency plan freeing up a $9.8 million loan that enabled the payroll(工资单) to be met for 2,700 teachers and staff in time for the holidays. 
District officials also took $1.7 million from student-activity accounts its 38schools. 
At Coffman’s request, the District Attorney has begun investigating the district’s finances. Coffman says he wants to know whether district officials hid the budget shortage until after the November election, when voters approved a $212 million bond issue for schools. 
In Frederick, students’ parents are buying classroom supplies and offering to pay for groceries and utilities to keep first-year teachers and principals in their jobs. 
Some $36,000 has been raised in donations from Safeway. A Chevrolet dealership donated $10,000 and forgave the district’s $10,750 bill for renting the driver educating cars. IBM contributed 4,500 packs of paper. 
“We employ thousands of people in this community,” said Mitch Carson, a hospital chief executive, who helped raise funds. “We have children in the school, and we see how they could be affected.” 
At Creek High School, three students started a website that displays newspaper articles, district information and an email forum(论坛)。 “Rumors about what’s happening to the district are moving at lighting speed,” said a student. “We wanted to know the truth, and spread that around instead.” 
26.What has happened to the Vrain School District? 
A)A huge financial problem has arisen. 
B)Many schools there are mismanaged. 
C)Lots of teachers in the district are planning to quit. 
D)Many administrative personnel have been laid off. 


27.How did the residents in the Vrain School District respond to the budget shortage? 
A) They felt somewhat helpless about it. 
B) They accused those responsible for it. 
C) They pooled their efforts to help solve it. 
D) They demanded a through investigation. 


28.In the view of State Treasurer Mike Coffman, the educational budget shortage is_________. 
A) unavoidable 
B)unthinkable 
C)insolvable 
D)irreversible 


29.Why did Coffman request an investigation? 
A)To see if there was a deliberate cover-up of the problem. 　 
B)To find out the extent of the consequences of the case. 
C)To make sure that the school principals were innocent. 
D)To stop the voters approving the $212 million bong issue.


30.Three high school students started a website in order to__________. 
A) attract greater public attention to their needs 
B) appeal to the public for contributions and donations 
C) expose officials who neglected their duties 
D) keep people properly informed of the crisis 


Passage Three 
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage. 
“Humans should not try to avoid stress any more than they would shun food, love or exercise.” Said Dr. Hans Selye, the first physician to document the effects of stress on the body. While here’s on question that continuous stress is harmful, several studies suggest that challenging situations in which you’re able to rise to the occasion can be good for you.. 
In a 2001 study of 158 hospital nurses, those who faced considerable work demands but coped with the challenge were more likely to say they were in good health than those who felt they stress that you can manage also boost immune(免疫的) function. In a study at the Academic Center for Dentistry in Amsterdam, researchers put volunteers through two stressful experiences. In the first, a timed task that required memorizing a list followed by a short test, subjects through a gory(血淋淋的) video on surgical procedures. Those who did well on the memory test had an increase in levels of immunoglobulin A, an antibody that’s the body’s first line of defense against germs. The video-watchers experienced a downturn in the antibody. 
Stress prompts the body to produce certain stress hormones. In short bursts these hormones have a positive effect, including improved memory function. “They can help nerve cells handle information and put it into storage,” says Dr. Bruce McEwen of Rockefeller University in New York. But in the long run these hormones can have a harmful effect on the body and brain. 
“Sustained stress is not good for you,” says Richard Morimoto, a researcher at Northwestern University in Illinois studying the effects of stress on longevity(长寿) ,”It’s the occasional burst of stress or brief exposure to stress that could be protective.” 
31. The passage is mainly about______ 
 A) the benefits of manageable stress 
 B)stay away from 
 C)run out of 
 D)put up with 
32. The word “shun”(Line 1,Para.1) most probably means________. 
 A)cut down on 
 B)stay away from 
 C)run out of 
 D)put up with 
33.We can conclude from the study of the 158 nurses in 2001 that_______ 
 A)people under stress tend to have a poor memory 
 B)people who can’t get their job done experience more stress 
 C)doing challenging work may be good for one’s health 
 D)stress will weaken the body’s defense against germs 
34.In the experiment described in Paragraph 3,the video-watchers experienced a downturn in the antibody because______. 
 A) the video was not enjoyable at all 
 B) the outcome was beyond their control 
 C)they knew little about surgical procedures 
 D)they felt no pressure while watching the video 
35.Dr. Bruce McEwen of Rockefeller University believes that______. 
 A)a person’s memory is determined by the level of hormones in his body 
 B)stress hormones have lasting positive effects on the brain 
 C)short bursts of stress hormones enhance memory function 
 D)a person’s memory improves with continued experience of stress. 


Passage Four 
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage. 


If you want to teach your children how to say sorry, you must be good at saying it yourself, especially to your own children. But how you say it can be quite tricky. 
 If you say to your children “I’m sorry I got angry with you, but …” what follows that “but” can render the apology ineffective: ” I had a bad day” or “your noise was giving me a headache ” leaves the person who has been injured feeling that he should be apologizing for his bad behavior in expecting an apology. 


Another method by which people appear to apologize without actually doing so is to say “I’m sorry you’re upset” ; this suggests that you are somehow at fault for allowing yourself to get upset by what the other person has done. 
 Then there is the general, all covering apology, which avoids the necessity of identifying a specific act that was particularly hurtful or insulting, and which the person who is apologizing should promise never to do again. Saying “I’m useless as a parent” does not commit a person to any specific improvement. 
 These pseudo-apologies are used by people who believe saying sorry shows weakness, Parents who wish to teach their children to apologize should see it as a sign of strength, and therefore not resort to these pseudo-apologies. 
 But even when presented with examples of genuine contrition, children still need help to become a ware of the complexities of saying sorry. A three-year-old might need help in understanding that other children feel pain just as he does, and that hitting a playmate over the head with a heavy toy requires an apology. A six-year-old might need reminding that spoiling other children’s expectations can require an apology. A 12-year-old might need to be shown that raiding the biscuit tin without asking permission is acceptable, but that borrowing a parent’s clothes without permission is not. 
36.If a mother adds ”but” to an apology,________. 
 A) she doesn’t feel that she should have apologized. 
 B) she does not realize that the child has been hurt 
 C) the child may find the apology easier to accept 
 D) the child may feel that he owes her an apology 
37.According to the author, saying “I’m sorry you’re upset” most probably means”_______” 
 A)You have good reason to get upset 
 B)I’m aware you’re upset ,but I’m not to blame 
 C)I apologize for hurting your feelings 
 D)I’m at fault for making you upset 
38.It is not advisable to use the general, all-covering apology because______. 
A)it gets one into the habit of making empty promises 
B)it may make the other person feel guilty 
C)it is vague and ineffective 
D)it is hurtful and insulting 
39.We learn from the last paragraph that in teaching children to say sorry______. 
 A)the complexities involved should be ignored 
 B)their ages should be taken into account 
 C)parents need to set them a good example 
 D)parents should be patient and tolerant 
40.It can be inferred from the passage that apologizing properly is _________. 
 A)a social issue calling for immediate attention 
 B)not necessary among family members 
 C)a sign of social progress 
 D) not as simple as it seems

Should the University Campus Be Open to tourism? 


Nowadays, many famous university campuses have become one of the popular tourist attractions. It has been shown on TV and on the radio that every year thousands and thousands of middle school students visit Tsing Hua University and Peking University and other famous universities in China. In the place far away from the capital city, the local students also visit the universities famous in their own province. 


 So far as the present situation is concerned, is it a good or bad thing to open the university campus for tourists? Different people have different opinions. On one hand, some people argued that it is a good thing for the students to visit the famous university campus in that it can enable the middle students to get more information about the university and they can have enough time and opportunity to prepare themselves with the chance to get into the university. On the other hand, some people hold a negative view about this phenomenon. In their opinion, the public tourism will have negative effect on the universities because it will not only do harm to the environment but also to the intellectual atmosphere. 


 In my opinion, the tourism to the universities is not a good thing. The campus is mainly a place for study. With the increasing tourism on the campus, it will ruin the spiritual atmosphere in this learning field.

1. W: Carol told us on the phone not to worry about her. Her left leg doesn’t hurt as much as it did yesterday.


M: She’d better have it examined by a doctor anyway. And I will call her about it this evening.


Q: What does the man think Carol should do?


2. M: There is a non-stop train for Washington and it leaves at 2:30.


W: It’s faster than the 2 o’clock train. Besides, we can have something to eat before getting on the train.


Q: What do we learn from the conversation?


3. M: Hi, Melissa, how’s your project going? Have you thought about going to graduate school? Perhaps you can get into Harvard.


W: Everything is coming along really well. I have been thinking about graduate school. But I’ll talk to my tutor Dr. Garcia first and see what she thinks.


Q: What do you learn about the woman from the conversation?


4. W: Did you attend Alice’s presentation last night? It was the first time for her to give a speech to a large audience.

Passage one


A new study reports the common drug aspirin greatly reduces life threatening problems after an operation to replace blocked blood vessels to the heart. More than 800,000 people around the world have this heart surgery each year. The doctors who carried out the study say giving aspirin to patients soon after the operation could save thousands of lives. People usually take aspirin to control pain and reduce high body temperature. Doctors also advise some people to take aspirin to help prevent heart attacks. About 10-15 percent of these heart operations end in death or damage to the heart or other organs. The new study shows that even a small amount of aspirin reduced such threats. The doctors said the chance of death for patients who took aspirin would fall by 67%. They claimed this was true if the aspirin was given within 48 hours of the operation. The doctors believe aspirin helps heart surgery patients because it can prevent blood from thickening and blood vessels from being blocked. However, the doctors warned that people who have stomach bleeding or other bad reactions from aspirin should not take it after heart surgery.


Questions 11 to 13 are based on the passage you have just heard.


11. What is the finding of the new study of aspirin?


12. In what way can aspirin help heart surgery patients according to the doctors?


13. What warning did the doctors give about the use of aspirin?





Passage Two


Were you the first or the last child in your family? Or were you a middle or an only child? Some people think it matters where you were born in your family. But there are different ideas about what birth order means. Some people say that oldest children are smart and strong-willed. They are very likely to be successful. The reason for this is simple. Parents have a lot of time for their first child; they give him or her a lot of attention. So this child is very likely to do well. An only child will succeed for the same reason. What happens to the other children in the family? Middle children don’t get so much attention, so they don’t feel that important. If a family has many children, the middle one sometimes gets lost in the crowd. The youngest child, though, often gets special treatment. He or she is the baby. Often this child grows up to be funny and charming. Do you believe these ideas of birth order too? A recent study saw things quite differently. The study found that first children believed in family rules. They didn’t take many chances in their lives. They usually followed orders. Rules didn’t mean as much to later children in the family. They went out and followed their own ideas. They took chances and they often did better in life.


Questions 14 to 16 are based on the passage you have just heard.


14. According to common belief, in what way are the first child and the only child alike?


15. What do people usually say about middle children?


16. What do we learn about later children in a family from a recent study of birth order?





Passage Three


When my interest shifted from space to the sea, I never expected it would cause such confusion among my friends, yet I can understand their feelings. As I have been writing and talking about space flight for the best part of 20 years, a sudden switch of interest to the depth of the sea doer seem peculiar. To explain, I’d like to share my reasons behind this unusual change of mind. The first excuse I give is an economic one. Underwater exploration is so much cheaper than space flight. The first round-trip ticket to the moon is going to cost at least 10 billion dollars if you include research and development. By the end of this century, the cost will be down to a few million. On the other hand, the diving suit and a set of basic tools needed for skin-diving can be bought for 20 dollars. My second argument is more philosophical. The ocean, surprisingly enough, has many things in common with space. In their different ways, both sea and space are equally hostile. If we wish to survive in either for any length of time, we need to have mechanical aids. The diving suit helped the design of the space suit. The feelings and the emotions of a man beneath the sea will be much like those of a man beyond the atmosphere.
